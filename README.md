WebGL-Assignment
================

Repository used to Assignment for CSCI 2160 Digital Media

This content was created as a pre requisite for a WebGL assignment 
for my Digital Media class at UOIT. For this assignment I follow 
and updated the outdated tutorial[1] to use the r66 version of three.js 
and teapot model.

I chose to use the MIT license for this assignment because any one can
follow the same tutorial and obtain the same results. Also, I don't care
if any use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute this respository and
codes.
